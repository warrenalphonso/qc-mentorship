    "**Update 1**: I started by defining my own classes/functions for creation/annihilation operators, the Jordan-Wigner transform, the square lattice for the Hubbard Hamiltonian, the Hubbard Hamiltonian's matrix representation, and the Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz (VHA). As expected, my code and computer's RAM wasn't enough to work with anything more than a 2x2 square lattice (which has 8 qubits, so exists 256-dimensional Hilbert space). What did surprise me was how much more efficient OpenFermion was, because when I tried it when SSHing onto a Google Cloud computer, I was able to quickly solve the ground state of up to a 2x10 square lattice Hubbard Hamiltonian. Most of the functions/classes I defined are still available in the tools/ folder if you want to take a look. "

    "The `HubbardSquareLattice` class has a useful method: `site_pair_iter(edge_type)`. We'll use the 'horizontal_neighbor' and 'vertical_neighbor' edge types. But we also need to differentiate between \"even\" and \"odd\" horizontal and vertical neighbors: even horizontal neighbors will be horizontal neighbors whose leftmost site has even index, and likewise for horizontal odd, vertical even, and vertical odd neighbors. To get this added specificity, we'll need to examine each item in the iterable generated by `site_pair_iter()`. We need the even and odd terms because then when we Trotterize the Hubbard Hamiltonian, we don't introduce any Trotter error, because the our four sets of tunneling terms (even horizontal, even vertical, odd horizontal, odd vertical) commute with each other. \n",
